/**
 * This class is used to generate a random "cave" map.
 * The map is generated as a two-dimensional array of ints, where "0" denotes floor and "1" denotes wall.
 * Initially, the boundaries of the cave are set to "wall", and the inner cells are set at random.
 * Then, a cellular automaton is run in order to smooth out the cave.
 *
